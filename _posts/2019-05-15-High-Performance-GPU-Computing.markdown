<ul>
  <li>Implemented a baseline many-core parallel algorithm for triangle counting using General Matrix Multiplication</li>
  <li>Optimized the algorithm by GPU specialized sparse matrix application, reducing runtime by 2-3 times</li>
  <li>Optimized the algorithm further by thread coarsening and privatization, accelerated runtime by 25%</li>
  <li>Counted the triangles with 200K nodes within 50s</li>
</ul>
