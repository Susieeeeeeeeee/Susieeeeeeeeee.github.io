> Always Somewhere✌️   

Hey，I am Susie. Nice to Meet you.[Github](https://github.com/Susieeeeeeeeee?tab=repositories)、[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/susieeeeee.song/?hl=en). I am a Master student in Computer Software Engineering at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, graduating by May 2019.
I have experience in system programming as well as web development. 

Before I came to University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, I had four year experience in State Grid Corporation of China as solution solver. I applied algorithms to improve state network efficiency. It is also the place where I learned dedication.

I quit my previous job because I always like to learn new things and I am a faster learner. I like to stay positive about everything and keep learning.
