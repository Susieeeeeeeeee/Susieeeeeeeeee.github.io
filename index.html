            Hey, I am Susie. Nice to Meet you 🤗.

        <div>
            I am a Master student in Computer Software Engineering at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, graduating by May 2019. I have experience in system programming, web development as well as other software development engineer's required skills.

            Before I came to University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, I had four year experience in State Grid Corporation of China as solution solver. I applied algorithms to improve state network efficiency. It is also the place where I learned dedication.

            I quit my previous job because I always like to learn new things and I am a faster learner. I like to stay positive about everything and keep learning.
